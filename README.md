# 🧩 Problem Statement
In today’s health-conscious world, people seek personalized nutrition, but most tools offer generic plans that ignore lifestyle, culture, allergies, and changing health needs. Nutritionists also struggle to scale personalized care due to time and resource limits.

# 💡 Proposed Solution
Generative AI can transform nutrition guidance through an intelligent, adaptive virtual assistant. Using NLP, multimodal inputs, and large dietary databases, it can create personalized meal plans, suggest smart food swaps, and explain choices. This project builds the “Smartest AI Nutrition Assistant” that understands text, voice, or images; tailors plans to health needs; explains food decisions; and adapts with feedback—bridging the gap between generic diet apps and real nutritionists
